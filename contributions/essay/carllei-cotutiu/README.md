### Topic
In this essay we discussed the opposition as well as collaboration relationship that exists between ITOps and Devops.
We started from understanding what ITOps involves, how it differs from DevOps and what are the core aspects that push these two apart.
We then explored how they can actually collaborate to enhance the development and maintenance process by ensuring flexibility and speed while maintaining stability and security.    

We believe that the subject is of great interest to DevOps because. Despite the opposing positions that each take in relationship to the other, the collaboration between them strikes a much-needed balance that accelerates the otherwise slow process associated with ITOps, while tempering the dynamic od DevOps.
